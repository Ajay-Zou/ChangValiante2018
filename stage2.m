%% Stage 2: Process the File
% Author: Michael Chang
% Run this file after the detection algorithm to analyze the results and do
% additional analysis to the detected events. This creats the time vector,
% LFP time series, LED if there is light, and filters the data.

%Create time vector
frequency = 1000000/samplingInterval; %Hz. si is the sampling interval in microseconds from the metadata
t = (0:(length(x)- 1))/frequency;
t = t';

%Seperate signals from .abf files
LFP = x(:,1);   %original LFP signal
if userInput(4)>0
    LED = x(:,userInput(4));   %light pulse signal, as defined by user's input via GUI
    onsetDelay = 0.13;  %seconds
    offsetDelay = 1.5;  %seconds
    lightpulse = LED > 1;
else
    LED =[];
    onsetDelay = [];
end

%Filter Bank
[b,a] = butter(2, ([1 100]/(frequency/2)), 'bandpass');
LFP_filtered = filtfilt (b,a,LFP);             %Bandpass filtered [1 - 100 Hz] singal
